# 283. Move Zeroes

## Information
- Submit Time: Apr 4
- tag: `java` `easy` `Array` `Two Pointers`
- url：https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/

## Description
Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Example:**
```
Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

## Note:
```
You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
Minimize the total number of operations.

```

## Hint：
* Hit1:
In-place means we should not be allocating any space for extra array. But we are allowed to modify the existing array. However, as a first step, try coming up with a solution that makes use of additional space. For this problem as well, first apply the idea discussed using an additional array and the in-place solution will pop up eventually.

* Hit2：
A two-pointer approach could be helpful here. The idea would be to have one pointer for iterating the array and another pointer that just works on the non-zero elements of the array.

## Solution



**Algorithm**
two-pointer

***Code***
```

public class moveZeroes {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // this is Leetcode 283
        int[] nums = {0,1,0,3,12};
        if (nums.length == 0 || nums == null || nums.length == 1) return;
        int left, right;
        left =  0;
        right = 1;
        
        //concern case: [1],[1,0],[1,0,1]
        //common case:[1,0,0,3,12]
        
        while(right < nums.length){           
            if(nums[left] == 0){               
                if(nums[right] != 0){
                  int temp = nums[right];
                    nums[right] = nums[left];
                    nums[left] = temp;
                    ++ left;
                }
                
            } 
            else{
               ++ left; 
            }
            ++right;
        }

        for (int i:nums){
            System.out.println(i);
        }
        
    }
}
```
